<h1>Netflix_Clone-Website </h1>

I've independently designed and coded a responsive Netflix_Clone website, and it's ready to explore!

ðŸ”¸ Project Name: [Netflix Clone Website]

ðŸ”¸ Technologies Used: React, Redux & Redux Thunk, React Router Dom, Axios for API requests, Slide Carousel for a sleek sliding feature, React Icons and Millify for enhanced UI

ðŸ”¸ Project Description: This website, which I designed and coded from scratch, works flawlessly on various devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. The project presents a modern interface mirroring the design of Netflix, offering an interactive and user-friendly experience. Utilizing The Movie Database (TMDb) API, it fetches real-time movie and TV show data, providing users with a broad spectrum of content.
